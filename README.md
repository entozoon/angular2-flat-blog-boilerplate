# Angular2 Flat Blog Test Project

(Check it out!)[https://entozoon.github.io/angular2-flat-blog-boilerplate/]

Just tinkering around with angular-cli and webpack, rather than a boilerplate.
For now, at least.

![Its a start!](posterity/1.gif)

## Creating a project from scratch!

    ng new projectName --style=scss

## Develop

    npm start

## Build

    ng build --prod

## Deploying

Using
[angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages),
build and deploy (NOTE: This'll be different for your project - look in
`package.json`), using:

    npm run deploy
